django-oida - [O]nly [I]f [D]ependency [A]vailable
==================================================

Oida provides you with a set of tools to execute parts of your code only
if a specified application is installed.

If your "django site" is powered by a core set of applications and you
add or remove several others to bundle up editions of it, you might end
up commenting and uncommenting lines in a shared code base. Although it
might be a good idea to keep your code as decoupled as possible, some 
parts are tricky: Think of the root URL configuration or enhanced admin 
views for models (If you have better solutions for that, please drop me
a note).


Templatetags
============
if_app: An if statement that validates to True if an app is loaded.

Example (the else tag is optional):
{% load apps %}
...
{% if_app "tagging" %}
    <p>tagging is installed</p>
{% else %}
    <p>tagging is not installed</p>
{% endif_app %}
