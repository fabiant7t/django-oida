django-oida - [O]nly [I]f [D] [A]vailable

Oida provides you with a set of tools to execute parts of your code only
if a specified application is installed.

If your "django site" is powered by a core set of applications and you
add or remove several others to bundle up editions of it, you might end
up commenting and uncommenting lines in a shared code base. Although it
might be a good idea to keep your code as decoupled as possible, some 
parts are tricky: Think of the root URL configuration or enhanced admin 
views for models (If you have better solutions for that, please drop me
a note).
